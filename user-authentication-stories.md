## User Story 3: Form Validation Feedback

I want to receive immediate feedback if I attempt to sign up or log in without entering all required details,  
**so that** I can correct the errors before submission.

## User Story 4: Persist User Data with Local Storage

**As a user**,  
I want my account details to be stored securely in local storage,  
**so that** my data persists between sessions for a smoother login experience.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- After successful registration, user details (e.g., username and token, but not raw password) are stored in local storage.
- During login, the app checks local storage for matching credentials or user ID.
- Users remain logged in unless they manually log out or clear their storage.
